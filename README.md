# StockSearch

Project link hosted on GCP - https://pb-123-hw8.wl.r.appspot.com/search/home

A webpage that allows users to search for stocks using the Finnhub API and display the results on the search page. 
A user will first open the home page, where the user can enter a stock ticker symbol and select from a list of matching stock symbols using “autocomplete.” 
A quote on a matched stock symbol can be performed.There are 4 routes for this application:


a) Home Route [‘/’] redirected to [‘/search/home’]– It is a default route of this application.

b) Search Details Route [‘/search/<ticker>’] – It shows the details of the <ticker> searched.
  
c) Watchlist Route [‘/watchlist’] – It displays the watchlist of the user.
  
d) Portfolio Route [‘/portfolio’] – It displays the portfolio of the user.
